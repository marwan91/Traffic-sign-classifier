## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
This project demonstrates the performance of the LeNet architecture to classify images. You will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, The model is tested through several images downloaded from the web.


The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

Python libraries required:
* matplotlib
* cv2
* numoy
* pickle
* tensorflow
* sklearn



### Instructions
* Make sure that the pickled dataset of the traffic sign images is located in the same directory as the python code.
* Make sure that the python libraries listed above are installed on your python environment.
* open the 'Traffic_Sign_Classifier-final.ipynb' file.
* Run the code cells from top to bottom.
